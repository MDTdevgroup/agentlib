  Search the web for the most recent articles or GitHub discussions about the Model Context Protocol (MCP). 
  Summarize what it is, what tools it provides, and any updates or implementations released in 2025. Then, 
  open the official MCP GitHub page in the browser and take a screenshot of the repository's main README 
  section. Save the summary and screenshot in ./reports as mcp_report.txt and mcp_repo.png. Finally, store 
  a memory note that I have already researched the MCP protocol so you dont repeat this task next time.
